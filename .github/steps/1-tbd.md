## Step 1: Enable Secret Scanning

_Welcome to "Introduction to Secret Scanning"! :wave:_

In this step, you will enable secret scanning on this repository. Once secret scanning is enabled, you will add a new credential to see how secret scanning identifies the credential.  

**What is a credential**: In the context of secret scanning, a credential is a plain-text string that autorizes a user to any number of third-party services.  Examples could be AWS secret access keys/ID's, Google API keys, or Stripe API tokens.  View our entire list of supported patterns [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets).
